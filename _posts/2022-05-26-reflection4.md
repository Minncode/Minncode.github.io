# Reflective Blog Entry 4


Name: Kim Minsung

Student number: s3866724

- "Description"

The topic of Lesson 7 that I learned in the lecture was ‘Computational Thinking’. At first, we briefly looked at the definition of what is ‘Computational Thinking’. And I studied four things of key skills for computational thinking in detail: Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Pattern Abstraction, Algorithm Design. After a short break, the teacher taught us about Caesar's Cipher Decision, which was used a lot in past wars. Lastly, based on what we learned, we formed a team and did activities to code break ourselves.

-	"Feeling"

I loved learning about the subject of Computational Thinking in class. Because this topic is related to IT, which is my major, and I've known some things similar to this since a long time ago. In addition, it was enjoyable to learn more deeply. My teacher recommended us to watch The Imitation Game, but I remember watching this movie in math class when I was in school in Korea.

-	"Evaluation"

The best thing to do was learn the Caesar Cipher Decryption. Since I was young, I really liked to deduce and decipher these things, so I bought books and watched a lot of videos. I forgot a little about decryption because it was an old memory but learning this concept in the class again makes me concentrate better. In addition, code breaking activities were exciting. There were only 4 students because it was an extra class, but I really participated in it. I think I became more passionate because I participated in activities in person, not just studying the definition of words. On negative, I hope to learn the next source, breaking an OTP. It looks hard, but I'm still curious.

-	"Analysis"

On reflection, fortunately, there was no activity or study that I had a hard time in this class. I think the reason is because I've heard it before and it's friendly and attractive. Especially, In Code breaking, I wrapped my head around my head for 20 minutes in the beginning and I really thought about how to solve it easily. My team member already solved the problem before I even prepared it, so I ended up doing it alone. In the process of solving it, I was thinking that I wanted to enter the IT major quickly and learn these things in more detail and depth. Everyone would have wanted to become a hacker or a white hacker at least once when they were young. Of course, I am interested in technology like code breaking, so I want to have a job like cybersecurity.

-	"Conclusion"

In conclusion, I learned about Caesar Cipher Decision in detail from 'Computational Thinking'. Thanks for teacher for explaining interesting topic and it was very meaningful time. Now, I think I should study more technical aspects.
