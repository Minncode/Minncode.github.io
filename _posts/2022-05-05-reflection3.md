# Reflective Blog Entry 3


Name: Kim Minsung

Student number: 3866724

- "Description"

The topic of Lesson 6 that I learned was ‘Collaboration and Teamwork’. At first, we looked at the definition of teamwork. And we saw why teamwork is so important and the benefits of teamwork. Next, we learned the five stages necessary to develop the team: Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing, Adjourning. Finally, we did Team Management Wheel activities through the site respectively.

-	"Feeling"

When I was in school in Korea, most of the assignments were individual assignments rather than teamwork activities. So, teamwork activities in Learning to Learn class were harder than I thought. But after taking this class, I became more confident than afraid. After learning what each team member should do and the key elements, I felt like I could do better, and I thought I would be able to successfully complete my group assignment soon. 

-	"Evaluation"

On the positive side, the teacher explained in detail and every important element of teamwork step by step, so it was effective in remembering how to do it. Therefore, I think I can do a constructive task if I apply what I learned to the group project. on the negative side, I think it would be good to learn more clearly the difference between group activities and independent work. Because the culture of education in my country is very competitive between individuals, there is almost no teamwork activity. So, learning the difference between the two would have been a good activity.

-	"Analysis"

On reflection, I was really afraid of being in a group project because I didn't have a close friend in my class and didn't have much teamwork before, but I think it was a helpful lecture because I got a direction from the teacher how to do it. Thanks to this class, I think the progress of the group assignment that I started with my classmate has become easier. It will not be easy to write 3000 characters, but I believe that communication, management, and dedication, which PowerPoint of Topic 6 says are important, will result in good grades and good friends.

-	"Conclusion"

In conclusion, I learned why teamwork is important and the steps to follow to develop the team more. In addition, I mastered essential knowledge by studying each key element more deeply at each stage.

-	"Action Plan"

To develop our team performing in the future, I will review the important parts of teamwork that I consider important in the class. And I will fix what I think is lacking and try not to conflict with the team. I will practice how to get the team's assignment in a better direction by looking it up on the Internet every day until the assignment is over.
