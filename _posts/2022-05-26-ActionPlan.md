# Blog and Action Plan


Name: Kim Minsung

Student number: s3866724

After taking all the classes in Introduction to Science and Technology, the technical perspective and the learning elements were systematically organized in my mind. Meaningful classes such as the Doing research part, code breaking, and guest instructors seem to have improved my cognitive and learning skills as well. To accomplish my purpose, I will become a student who gain a lot of technical experience in school based on what I learned in this course and become a successful student in my major for 3 years. And I will try to develop and make my own coding skills or core programs that are essential in my major. During the three-year curriculum at school, I will learn various information by independently reviewing numerous IT-related books and rice paddies in the library. Also, while studying, I will ask my teacher what I don't know so that I can have a deeper knowledge of the skills of coding programs. In addition, I found that there are no IT-related clubs in the school. So, I will try to improve the technical teamwork of the school by making an IT-related club with friends who are interested in it. This is because I think that through this club, people who are interested in IT like me can develop their abilities even more and make RMIT better. After this, I want to be an influential person in the IT industry.
