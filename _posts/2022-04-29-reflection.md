# Reflective Blog Entry 1

Name: Kim Minsung
Student number: 3866724

	Description
The topic of the class I recently learned was ‘Doing research’. First, I had time to discuss research with my classmates and learned the definition and examples of induction and deduction. Then the teacher explained the structure of the research, which is related to our group assignment. Finally, we studied what 'Exploratory versus confirmatory research' is.

	Feeling
I was a little afraid learning this topic because I did not know much about it. However, thanks to what I learned from this class, I am glad that it will be usefully applied to the assignments of this course and future IT majors. And I feel confident that I will be able to do well on the group assignment that will be coming soon.

	Evaluation
The best thing happened was when I learned the research structure. This activity is because I do not have any experience about research project before, and I thought knowing this would be beneficial in a group project. In addition, the teacher explained the terms I was not familiar with, so it was easier to understand the content of the class. Especially, I was most confused about Induction versus deduction, but Sherlock's videos and examples helped me a lot to interpret it.

	Analysis
I think the part of Induction versus deduction was a successful learning for me. In addition to the teacher's well-description, I searched the Internet for various examples and how to apply it separately to make this part my own. Therefore, it seems that I can have my own knowledge that can prove the theory of my research later. Through the learning of research structure, I got one step closer to the group project. so, this also seems to be a successful experience. When I first saw it on Canvas, it seemed very difficult to write 3000 characters, but if I follow what I learned this time, I think there will be no problem. It was a meaningful help to me because my teacher taught me from the basics of this topic to how to apply it in class.

	Conclusion
This topic made it possible to fully understand the structure of the research and the essential elements of my major. I think everything I learned this time is very important, so I will try to review it more.

	Action Plan
I will look for examples and videos on the Internet every other day to improve my ability in the Induction version reduction and research. And I will study various materials through canvas and I will be a student who reviews what I learned.
