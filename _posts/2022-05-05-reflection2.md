# Reflective Blog Entry 2


Name: Kim Minsung

Student number: 3866724

-	"Description"

The topic of Lesson 4 that I learned in this class was ‘Engagement and Effective Oral Communication’. The first activity I did was to discuss the various purposes of the presentation with my classmates and why. Next, we learned how to explain based on who the audience is (high, medium, low). After that, we did a group activity to analyze the essay given by the teacher and find out which key elements should be included in the PowerPoint. Finally, we studied how to develop and solve presentations to make them look better.

-	"Feeling"

Since I was in high school, I have done a lot of activities such as explaining in front of other people and giving presentations using PowerPoint. So, this class was more friendly, easy to understand, and comfortable. Especially, I am glad that the part of how to develop a presentation helped my lack of skills.

-	"Evaluation"

On a positive note, setting up who your audience is when describing your content and learning the basics of analyzing a presentation has been very appealing to me. I often made a lot of presentations based on myself rather than the audience, but I came to realize why it is important to do it at a high level for someone and a low level for someone else and in what way. In addition, I think that learning how to create graphs and processes concise and neat will be of great help when preparing for a presentation later.

-	"Analysis"

On reflection, all parts of this class seem to be useful information for me. First, I learned why the audience is important when giving a presentation. Everyone is different and the presentation should be tailored to the audience so that my opinion can be easily and appropriately communicated, and the purpose of the presentation can be achieved. Second, the presentation analysis part will be a useful help for the group presentation of assignment 1. I found that the background, fonts, colors, and graphs of the presentation I learned in this class all affect my ultimate purpose. Therefore, I will try my best to create a complete and easy-to-understand presentation through what I have learned.

-	"Conclusion"

In conclusion, I learned how to make a presentation for the audience. I also learned to make the information I want to convey easy to see briefly.

-	"Action Plan"

In order to develop my presentation skills, I will look up various materials related to my major on the Internet every weekend. I will choose one of them and see which part was good or bad and then try to apply it to my future presentation graph and description in good ways.
